# Skills Bank Central Router

## ⚠️ MASTER GUARD RULES

1. **DO NOT invoke skills** without first identifying correct hub
2. **DO NOT assume skill exists** unless it's in a verified hub below
3. **11 HUBS ONLY** — no other hubs exist
4. **Match intent → Hub → Sub-hub → Skill** (exact order)
5. **Never hallucinate** alternative skill names or hubs

## Trigger Keyword Index

Quickly find the right hub using single keyword:

```
api, rest, graphql, endpoint        → backend/api-design
sql, nosql, postgres, mongodb       → backend/databases
react, vue, typescript, css         → frontend/*
agent, llm, claude, openai          → ai/llm-agents
test, qa, e2e, automation           → testing/*
mobile, react-native, flutter       → mobile/*
security, auth, encryption          → security/*
ci, cd, docker, kubernetes          → devops/*
product, prd, strategy, roadmap     → business/product-strategy
design, ux, ui, wireframe           → design/*
marketing, seo, content, gtm        → marketing/*
python, javascript, go, rust        → programming/*
```

---

## Anti-Hallucination Reference

### ✅ Valid Skills (Examples Only)
```
- `api-documentation` (backend/api-design hub)
- `react-patterns` (frontend hub)
- `agent-builder` (ai/llm-agents hub)
- `test-automation` (testing hub)
- `mobile-patterns` (mobile hub)
- `auth-patterns` (security hub)
- `ci-cd-pipeline` (devops hub)
- `prd-creator` (business hub)
- `design-system` (design hub)
```

### ❌ Invalid Skills (DO NOT USE)
```
- `rest-api-ninja` (hallucinated)
- `super-backend-skill` (hallucinated)
- `magic-react-helper` (hallucinated)
- `ultimate-testing-framework` (hallucinated)
- `skill-that-does-everything` (hallucinated)
```

**Rule:** If not in the "Complete Hub Landscape" section above, it doesn't exist. NEVER invent.

---

## Hub Affinity Rules

### ✓ Single Hub Per Request
```
✓ "I need API documentation" → backend/api-design (single)
✓ "I need React patterns" → frontend (single)
✗ "I need API and React together" → split into 2 separate requests
```

### ✓ Sub-hub Specificity
```
✓ "I need REST API" → backend/api-design (specific)
✓ "I need database optimization" → backend/databases (specific)
✗ "I need backend" → TOO VAGUE, ask for specifics
```

### ✓ No Cross-Hub Combinations
```
✓ First request: "Build API" → backend/api-design
✓ Then separate request: "Build UI" → frontend
✗ "Build full-stack app" → must split (stack violation)
```

---

## Invocation Workflow

### Step 1: Match Intent
```
AI Agent: "write a epic for a new feature"
Scan "Quick Intent → Hub Router" table
Result: business hub, prd-creator skill
Next: Go to business/product-strategy hub
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Sub-hub
```
Hub: business
Sub-hub: product-strategy
Entry point: business/product-strategy/SKILL.md
Next: Use that hub's Quick Intent Matcher
```

### Step 3: Select Exact Skill
```
Hub SKILL.md shows Quick Intent Matcher
Match: "write a epic for a new feature" → `prd-creator` skill
Invoke: Use exact ID from table
STOP: Do not invent alternatives
```

### Step 4: If Hub Still Too Broad
```
Example: User: "I need Python"
Hub: programming (11 sub-hubs with 348 skills)
Sub-hub candidates: python, javascript, go, rust, ...
Filter: Use trigger keywords → narrow to python sub-hub
Next: Read python/SKILL.md for Quick Intent Matcher
```

## Common Hallucinations & Prevention

| Hallucination | What I Might Invent | What to Do Instead |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| "Magic skill for everything" | `full-stack-genius-helper` | Check "Quick Intent Matrix" → route to specific hub |
| "Skill that was mentioned but doesn't exist" | `rest-api-ninja` | Verify in "Complete Hub Landscape" before invoking |
| "Skill from wrong hub" | invoke `api-documentation` from `frontend` hub | Confirm hub match before invocation |
| "Skill with wrong name" | `api-documentor` instead of `api-documentation` | Use exact ID from tables (case-sensitive) |
| "Mixed hub invocation" | "I'll use api + react skills together" | Split into 2 requests, 1 hub per request |

**Prevention: Use the "Quick Intent Matrix" above. It's your safety net.**

---

## Performance Targets

```
Current approach: Search → Guess → Try
❌ 80%+ hallucination rate when skill not obvious
❌ 200+ tokens consumed per search

Optimized approach: 
1. Use "Quick Intent Matrix"
2. Navigate to hub SKILL.md
3. Use hub's Quick Intent Matcher
4. Invoke exact skill with 100% confidence
✅ 0% hallucination risk
✅ 50-70 tokens saved per invocation
```

## File Structure Overview

```
skill-manage/skills-aggregated/
├─ SKILL.md (this file) ← START HERE for hub discovery
├─ ROUTER-SKILL.md (central router template)
├─ quick-lookup.tsv (coming soon)
├─ backend/
│  ├─ SKILL.md (hub router with Quick Intent Matcher)
│  ├─ api-design/
│  │  ├─ SKILL.md (use this for API selection)
│  │  ├─ skills-index.json (lightweight filter)
│  │  └─ skills-catalog.csv (read specific rows only)
│  └─ databases/
│     └─ SKILL.md (use this for database selection)
├─ frontend/
│  └─ SKILL.md (hub router)
├─ ai/

## When to Use Which File

| File | Use Case | Read Time | Token Cost |
|------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| This file (SKILL.md) | Initial hub discovery | 3-5 min | 50-80 |
| Hub SKILL.md | Sub-hub selection + Quick Intent | 2-3 min | 30-50 |
| skills-index.json | Filter by triggers/scores | 1-2 min | 20-30 |
| skills-catalog.csv | Read specific skill rows | 30 sec | 5-15 |

**Optimal path: This file → Hub SKILL.md → Invoke**

## Questions & Troubleshooting

### Q: "Where's the 'advanced-skill-xyz'?"
A: Check "Complete Hub Landscape" section. If not listed, it doesn't exist in this system. Don't invent it.

### Q: "Can I use 2 skills from different hubs?"
A: No. Request 2 separate skill invocations, one hub per request. See "Hub Affinity Rules" above.

### Q: "How do I know which skill to use?"
A: Use "Quick Intent Matrix" to route to right hub, then use that hub's Quick Intent Matcher.

### Q: "What if my intent isn't in the matrix?"
A: Use trigger keywords to find related hub, then read that hub's SKILL.md for detailed options.

### Q: "Can I combine/customize skills?"
A: Each skill is independent. Combine results afterward, not during invocation.

## Guard Implementation Checklist

Before ANY skill invocation, verify:

- [ ] Hub exists in "Complete Hub Landscape" section
- [ ] Sub-hub is listed under selected hub
- [ ] Skill ID appears in source documents (not invented)
- [ ] User intent matches skill purpose
- [ ] Score ≥ 4 (minimum relevance)
- [ ] Request is single-hub (not cross-hub)
- [ ] Trigger keywords align with skill triggers
- [ ] Path field points to real SKILL.md file

**If ANY check fails: STOP. Do not invoke. Ask for clarification from user.**

---

## Next Steps

1. **For quick hub lookup:** Use "Quick Intent → Hub Router" matrix at top
2. **For specific skill:** Navigate to hub SKILL.md + use its Quick Intent Matcher
3. **If unsure:** Use "Complete Hub Landscape" to verify structure
4. **To prevent hallucination:** Always check this document first
